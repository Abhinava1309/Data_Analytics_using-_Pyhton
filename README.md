# 🧪 Data Analytics Projects using Python

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**! This repository contains a series of hands-on data analysis projects developed using Python and popular data libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.

Each project tackles a different dataset or domain and walks through the steps of data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and interpretation of results.

## 📌 To Do (Suggestions)

- [ ] Clean `.zip` files from Git history (`COVID19.zip`)
- [ ] Rename repo to fix typo (`Pyhton` → `Python`)
- [ ] Add visual previews (charts, heatmaps) as images in `README`
- [ ] Add `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
